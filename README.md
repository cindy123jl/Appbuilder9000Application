# Introduction 
Part of the Live Project for the Python Course. An application with an app I created called the AnimeApp.

# Application Details for AnimeApp
The Anime App has many functions. When you click on the AnimeApp on the home screen it will take you to the application I created. It will have a welcome page with a navigation bar where you can navigate to different parts of the application. You will be able to create a review of any Anime and the review you created would be populated to the reviews page, on the reviews page you can see all the reviews ever made. I have another feature where you can look at the details of a specific anime that has been reviewed and that would be under the display tab.
